# TODO-List

This is a completely open-source todolist. It was created for a subject at the Norwegian University of Agder, where the goal was creating something with only open-source components. The application uses React for frontend, with node and express making out the backend, together with a Postgresql server. Our goal is to make this application easy for anyone else to build on, something we will accomplish by both making it easily accessable through this github page, with tutorials on how new users can both use, and contribute to the project.

Please visit [getting started](https://github.com/EliasBN/todo/blob/elias/guides/gettingstarted.md) if you want to learn how to contribute. If you simply want to know how we've created this application then you can read about the structure and software used further down on this document.
