# TODO-List

This is an open-source todolist. It was created for a subject at the Norwegian University of Agder, where the goal was creating something with only open-source components. The application uses React for frontend, with node and express making out the backend, together with a Postgresql database. Our goal is to make this application easy for anyone else to build on, something we will accomplish by both making it easily accessable through this github page, with tutorials on how new users can both use, and contribute to the project.

This project has been started by the following collaborators:

- [Erik Urdal Gundersen](https://github.com/Erikug)   
- [Elias Berg Nordheim](https://github.com/EliasBN)   
- [Victor Prestholm](https://github.com/Prestholm)  
- [Henning Van Ta](https://github.com/Henningermaskin)

## Purpose of project
The reason why we chose to create this todolist, and why we wanted to make it open source, is that it's a great way for new developers to get into JavaScript, especially Node(backend) and React (frontend). Developing the application open source with an MIT licence means that other people are free to implement this list into their own projects. In addition, a todolist can always be nice to have, and for developers it can be especially fun to experience what it feels like to personally help develop something which you can use every single day.  

## What the application currently looks like
