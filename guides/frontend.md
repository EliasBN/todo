# Getting Started with the React Todo-list

## Setup

1. Clone the project from https://github.com/EliasBN/todo

`$ git clone git@github.com:EliasBN/todo.git` with SSH  
`$ git clone https://github.com/EliasBN/todo.git` with HTTPS

2. This will of course give you both the front- and backend. Navigate into the frontend app.
   `cd frontend`

3. Install all dependencies using NPM
   `npm install`

4. Run a local development server
   `npm start`

This is everything you need to do if you want to run the application. If you however want to also setup your application with "proper" Crud and database connectivity then you can follow the [backend-guide](https://github.com/EliasBN/todo/blob/elias/guides/backend.md).
